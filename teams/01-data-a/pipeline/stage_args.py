"""How run_pipeline.py hands paths to the three stage scripts it can run (clean, overlap, dedup).

A stage's folders are decided once, in the run config, and never typed again: a stage reads the previous stage's folder and
writes its own. This module turns that into the command each script needs. All three scripts read their paths from a JSON
config, so each gets a copy of its settings file at <cfg_dir>/<stage>.json with the path keys filled in (repo-relative, as the
scripts require), and is run with --config on that copy:
  clean     input_root = the stage's "input", output_root = <clean folder>, and the input set's description from the stage:
            manifest (default: sample_manifest.json in the input folder), manifest_sha256, expected_parts, sample.
            run_tokenizer_sample.py also takes one --only <part> per part of the stage's "only" list (a trial on some parts)
  overlap   inputs = <clean folder>, out = <overlap folder>
  dedup     results = <overlap folder>, inputs = <clean folder>, out = <dedup folder>

The settings file holds settings only (k, floor, pack order, pins); it is never edited. Its sha256 and the generated copy's are
returned so the manifest can record them, and a "settings_sha256" in the stage's run config is checked when present.

  build("overlap", spec, folders=..., cfg_dir=..., repo=...) -> {"command", "settings", "settings_sha256", "config", "config_sha256"}
