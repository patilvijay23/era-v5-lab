"""A finished synthetic pipeline run for the shard tests, made by run_pipeline.py itself.

clean, overlap and dedup are adopted (made-up folders in dedup's real formats, from pipeline/tests); apply and
survivor_loss run for real, and F2 is the pipeline tests' stand-in (fake_run_f2.py), which drops the doc_ids in
FAKE_F2_DROP. No real data: every document is made up by the test.
