"""Write a shard for every part in a pipeline run's final folder: shard_writer.py once per part.

  python -I teams/01-data-a/shards/run_shards.py --input <run>/final --manifest <run>/pipeline_manifest.json \
      --tokenizer <c3>/tokenizer.json --out <dir> [--pack code-go ...] [--tokens N] [--any-tokenizer]

--input is the run's final folder: <input>/<split>/<pack>/<part>.parquet, the layout run_pipeline.py gives it. Every part
found is handed to shard_writer.py (the split comes from the folder name), except a part in a folder named in
NOT_SHARDED (heldout, validation, val): it is reported as "not_sharded", which is not an error, because what a held-out
part becomes is for G3 and G9 to say. Language, script, domain and lane come from the pack's row in pack_table.json; a pack that is not in the
table, or has a null field, is not sharded (status "skipped"). The shard number is the part's number: part-00001.parquet
is <pack>-<split>-000001.

Before anything is written it checks that none of the shards it would write is already in --out, and stops if one is.
A part the writer stops on (a broken link in its chain, ...) is recorded as "failed" and the run goes on.
It exits 1 unless every part was written or not_sharded.

When it is done it checks the shards that are in --out (verify_shards.py: files, hashes, format, counts, pack table, and the first
and last document of each shard against the final part), not only what it just wrote. A part whose shard fails a check becomes
"failed" with the reason; a problem that belongs to no part (cleaning_pipeline.json missing, a shard no part accounts for) goes
to "problems" in the summary; any problem makes the exit code 1. "verified" is true when the checks found nothing, false when
they did, and null when there was no shard to check.

Writes <out>/shards_summary.json: for each part its status, shard_id, docs, tokens, rows read of the rows in the part,
"truncated" (the writer fills a shard up to --tokens and drops the rest of the part; several shards per part are not
written yet), and the docs left out, with the run_id and the sha256 of cleaning_pipeline.json. A second run into the same --out
with --pack adds to the summary; one made for another run_id is refused, and the writer refuses other processing part by part.
Needs what shard_writer.py needs.
